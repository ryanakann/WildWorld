# Quick Start
## The purpose of this repo is to compile a bunch of Unity projects that focus on one mechanic (i.e. a character controller repo, an audio manager repo, etc.).
## 1) Add your project to the repo
## 2) Copy the .gitignore file from the root directory to your project's root directory via File Explorer or Command Line
## 3) Push as usual. As long as you stay in your own repo, you are more than welcome to push to Master.
